# Collections

- `raw/` stores the exported Postman collections. These are the files you import/export from Postman.
- `build/` is generated by `plaintest scripts sync` and contains runnable copies with scripts inlined.
- `README.md` (this file) documents the folder layout.

Collections available:
- `get_password` – phase 1 credential fetch
- `pan_validation_tests` – CSV-driven suite
- `pan_validation_smoke` – smoke coverage

Always edit the raw exports in Postman and run `../../plaintest scripts sync` from the project root to regenerate the build copies and script files.
